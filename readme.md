Hi Adam!
Here is a place for code...

Your mission is to figure out how to add a file!

However this maybe over kill... duno

Is there a pico8 way of sharing?


Links you gave me:

  + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOcZonu65hE&ab_channel=bridgs

I watched this and did a bit of coding. Which worked!

## Using git

  + Down laod the repo:  

git clone  git@github.com:robsaunders123/pico8.git  

If you get errors here then there could be a port block or something that will need
some configuration to fix.

If this worked you will have a local copy of the files and the whole repo (in .git).
This will include all the history of any changes made.
What is good about this is that if you make a mistake you can revert back, this is a
massive help.
